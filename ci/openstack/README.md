The playbook in this directory is an example to replace the current libvirt-based playbook with
one that would use the openstack API. It won't work 'as is' and would require some little adjustments, but
it shows the logic and main steps.

A working example can be found in git history, see commit : 82c91e7d630012b104bda4fa2ef0400e6f3e02c9
